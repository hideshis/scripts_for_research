transparency.

__commit_message__:
HTTPCLIENT-1164: Implemented a new CompressionDecorator aimed at replacing
the ContentEncodingHttpClient. This reuses the same request/response
interceptors with some minor additions to make the resulting response
semantically consistent (i.e. if a response is uncompressed, we mark the
entity as having an unknown length and remove the Content-Length header
before passing the response upstream). This allows the CompressionDecorator
and CachingHttpClient to be wired around a DefaultHttpClient in either order
and still get cache hits, depending on whether you want to cache compressed
or uncompressed bodies.

Minor change to ResponseContentEncoding to set a context variable that the
uncompression was applied. Only other change was to deprecate the
ContentEncodingHttpClient.

__commit_message__:
HTTPCLIENT-1153: Added a hashing scheme to map the higher-level
logical storage keys the CachingHttpClient wants to store cache
entries under onto a keyspace suitable for use with memcached
(which has a max key length smaller than the logical keys we use).
A default hashing scheme based on SHA-256 is also provided.
Finally, since hashing now introduces the possibility of collisions,
we have to store the logical storage key along with the cache entry
itself so that it can be compared on retrieval. Implemented a new
serialization scheme to accommodate this (with associated interfaces
so this could be overridden if desired). Unfortunately, this meant
that one of the existing constructors that accepted an old-style
custom serializer had to be deprecated (default implementations of
the new serializers are used instead).

  is not provided by Maven Central, so we couldn't build the project
  if the memcached jar wasn't already in the local repository. I added
  a <repository> for the pom for httpclient-cache, since that's the
  only module that needs it, but if we'd prefer to put that in the
  parent pom I can certainly move it there too (not sure what the
  prevailing opinion is on this).

__commit_message__:
HTTPCLIENT-1073: In the event a 100 (Continue) response makes its way up
to the caching module, but the original request did not expect one, it's
acceptable for the caching module to throw an exception but it had better
consume the body of the 100 (Continue) response before doing so to ensure
proper release of resources. Encountering this would require the underlying
(non-caching) HttpClient to not handle the expect-continue handshake properly
*AND* for the origin server to send a 100-Continue response out of turn
*WITH* a response body. Highly unlikely, but at least this codepath is
covered properly now.

HTTPCLIENT-1073: receiving a 206 (Partial Content) response to a

However, we should properly consume the body of the 206 response
before throwing the exception to ensure that resources are properly
released.

We address this by looking for no-cache and then filtering the
above directives out if present.

Implementation fix and acceptance tests for protocol recommendation:

"Many HTTP/1.0 cache implementations will treat an Expires value that
is less than or equal to the response Date value as being equivalent
to the Cache-Control response directive "no-cache". If an HTTP/1.1
cache receives such a response, and the response does not include a
Cache-Control header field, it SHOULD consider the response to be non-
cacheable in order to retain compatibility with HTTP/1.0 servers."

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.3

Also had to update a few other test cases that incidentally ran afoul
of this recommendation.

throws an UnsupportedOperationException if you try to get at the variant
map but the old set-based data structure is there; now we handle this
exception, log a warning, and then use the old structure. This is a bit
less efficient but still demonstrably works (I added a unit test to the
Ehcache suite, where you can submit a custom serializer, that shows that
the implementation still conforms to all the MUST/MUST NOTs).

removing unit tests that exercised some protected methods, especially
where they are already covered by acceptance tests against a public
interface (unit testing protected methods leads to brittle tests). Also
rewrite some of the unit tests in TestCachingHttpClient to depend on
fewer mocks (often, just a mock backend HttpClient and mock cache
storage).

those of the current request.

find the appropriate entry when handling a 304 indicating we
should use an existing variant.

HTTPCLIENT-1032: variant storage now separates a "variant key" (determined by
the portion of a request covered by Vary headers on an entry) from a
"variant cache key" (the place in the cache storage where a particular variant
response is stored). The variantMap in an HttpCacheEntry now maps variant keys
to variant cache keys, setting us up for the possibility of having multiple
variant keys point to the same variant cache entry.

HTTPCLIENT-1032: change variant storage mechanism in HttpCacheEntry from
a Set to a Map; Set-based interface retained for backwards-compatibility.
Currently, the map just maps a variantURI to itself--in essence it is
still really just a set; however, this sets us up for mapping different
variant keys to the same cache key (coming next).

__commit_hash__:

__commit_message__:
* Added handling of exceptions to the HttpClient#execute methods that take a ResponseHandler as a parameter

* Modified AbstractVerifier to use log instead of printStackTrace()

* Modified BasicResponseHandler to always throw an exception when status >= 300, even if entity == null

* Fixed concurrency problem in ConnectionPoolByRoute. Before this change, the RouteSpecificPool could be removed between the time that the waiting thread was notified and it actually woke up. The code was modified to not remove the thread from the RSP until it wakes up, so pool.isUnused() returns false when a thread is actually still waiting.

* Reordered date patterns in DateUtils. Someone claimed this enhanced performance.

* Small Javadoc fix in NetscapeDraftSpec

* Modified RFC2109Spec#formatCookies() to not modify the passed in list (it could be unmodifiable)

__commit_message__:
simplified keep-alive support.  changed ConnectionKeepAliveStrategy to return time in ms, instead of time & timeunit in two different calls.  reverted ConnectionReleaseTrigger.releaseConnection to take zero params & instead added a setIdleDuration method to ManagedClientConnection, along with converting direct uses of ClientConnectionManager.releaseConnection to instead go through ManagedClientConnection.releaseConnection (which now uses the idle time when giving itself to the manager).

__commit_message__:
* Redesigned the way the local execution context is handled: If a custom context is given, it gets wrapped with the DefaultedHttpContext that defaults to the parent execution context containing default values of all mandatory execution attributes. Therefore the local context can now contain only those attributes the user wishes to override. There is no longer a need to populate the local context with all mandatory attributes.
* Added a new context parameter for preferred auth schemes

__commit_message__:
HTTPCLIENT-763: AbstractClientConnAdapter#abortConnection() does not release the connection if called from the main execution thread while there is no blocking I/O operation.

AbstractClientConnAdapter#abortConnection() is usually expected to be called from a helper thread in order to unblock the main execution thread blocked in an I/O operation. It may be unsafe to call AbstractClientConnAdapter#releaseConnection() from the helper thread, so we have to rely on an IOException thrown by the closed socket on the main thread to trigger the release of the connection back to the connection manager. However, if this method is called from the main execution thread it should be safe to release the connection immediately. Besides, this also helps ensure the connection gets released back to the manager if AbstractClientConnAdapter#abortConnection() is called from the main execution thread while there is no blocking I/O operation.

__commit_hash__:
2b91201
__commit_message__:
Refactoring of the TSCCM code:
* Removed code maintaining a weak reference to the parent connection manager in the AbstractConnPool. The weak reference to the connection manager is currently used to shut down the pool when the connection manager gets GC-ed. The same net result can be achieved by calling #shutdown from #finalize() of the connection manager class.
* Shut down connection managers in #finalize().
* There is no point passing ClientConnectionOperator around. It can be assigned to the connection pool once at the construction time.

HTTPCLIENT-652:

* Reverting most of my previous changes. Passing a state object to the connection manager when trying to obtain a connection is completely pointless, as usually connection state information becomes available only after the connection has been established, for instance, after having been challenged by an authenticating server. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to set a state object on an active connection
* added method to set state object on ManagedClientConnection

This patch effectively reverts HTTPCLIENT-643 changes. Multihome fail-over mechanism simply cannot be properly implemented at the socket factory level. A failure in the connect method can leave the socket in a inconsistent state on some platforms (Mac OS), making it impossible to connect the same socket to a different address
